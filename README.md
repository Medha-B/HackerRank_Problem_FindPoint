# HackerRank_Problem_FindPoint
Consider two points,  and . We consider the inversion or point reflection, , of point  across point  to be a  rotation of point  around .  Given  sets of points  and , find  for each pair of points and print two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of  and  on a new line.  Input Format  The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of sets of points. Each of the  subsequent lines contains four space-separated integers describing the respective values of , , , and  defining points  and .  CoOutput Format  For each pair of points  and , print the corresponding respective values of  and  as two space-separated integers on a new line. Credits to HackerRank for the problem and main().
